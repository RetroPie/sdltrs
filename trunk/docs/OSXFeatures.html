<br>
</big></big><img style="width: 768px; height: 113px;" alt="" src="images/MediaWindow.png"><br>

<br>
The Media Status Window on the SDLTRS emulator allows you to
control all of the aspects of digital media emulation from one
graphical interface.&nbsp; Besides media management, it allow you to control
some often used aspects of the emulator as well.&nbsp; If it is not
displayed at the moment, you can display if by issuing the "Show Media
Status Window" command in the Media menu.&nbsp; <br>


<br>
 The status window contains the following elements:<br>
 <br>
 <b><u>Disk Image pushbuttons:</u><br> </b>
<blockquote>This section of the window provides pushbuttons allowing you to access
some of the common disk functions that are normally available in the
Media menu or the Disk Drive Management window, related to disk sets and creating disk images.&nbsp; See the <a href="#Media_Menu">Media Menu</a> help page for full explanations of the commands. </blockquote>
<b><u>Displayed Drives selector:</u><br> </b>
<blockquote>This section of the window controls which disk drives are shown in the
Disk Drive Status display to the right of it.&nbsp; You may choose to
display either the first four floppies, the second four floppies, or the hard drives.<br> </blockquote>
<b><u>Disk Drive Status Display/Buttons:</u><br> </b>
<blockquote>This section of the window allows you to control one of the emulated
disk drives on the TRS-80.&nbsp; You may insert a disk image by
pressing the Insert button.&nbsp; You also can drag and drop a disk image
file from the finder to the drive picture to insert the disk.&nbsp; When an
image is inserted, you can write protect/unprotected with the Lock/Unlock
button.&nbsp; When the drive is write protected, a small lock icon will
appear above the lock button.&nbsp; Finally, you can drag disks from one
drive to another as well. &nbsp;If you hold the option key while dragging a
disk, the disks between the two drives will be swapped, as opposed to
just moving the disk from one drive to another.<br> <br> Status may
also be displayed by the drives.&nbsp; Insert/eject, and
lock/unlock buttons will light up/darken when disks are
inserted/removed, etc.&nbsp; Also, there is a LED on the drive.&nbsp; It indicates read/write activity.<br> </blockquote>
<b><u>Cassette Drive Display/Buttons:</u></b><br>
<blockquote>
This section of the window allows you to control the emulated cassette
drive on the TRS-80.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may insert or remove a cassette image with
the Insert/Eject button.&nbsp; The Manage button will take you to the cassette management window, see the <a href="#Control_Menu">Control Menu </a>help section for details.<br> </blockquote>
<b><u>Printer Control Menu/Button:</u></b><br>
<blockquote>
This section of the window allows you to chose which printer emulation
you are using from the "Select" pulldown. &nbsp;You may choose the None, Text
Printer, or Epson FX-80. &nbsp;The picture of the
selected printer will be displayed in this section. &nbsp;The menu also has
an option to reset the printer, which is equivalent to turning the
printer off and on. &nbsp;The Preview button is used to view what the
current printer output looks like. &nbsp;It is active for every printer
emulation except the Text Printer. &nbsp;For more info on Printer Emulation,
see the <a href="#Printer_Emulation">Printer Emulation</a> help section. &nbsp;For setting the printer options, see the <a href="#Printer_Tab">Printer Tab</a> in Preferences.<br> </blockquote>
<b><u>Emulator Control pushbuttons:</u></b><br>
<blockquote>
This section of the window provides pushbuttons allowing you to access
some of the common emulator control functions that are normally
available in the Control Menu, such as resets and model selection.&nbsp; See the <a href="#Control_Menu">Control Menu</a> help section for full explanations of the commands.<br> </blockquote>

<big style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><big><a name="Display_Tab"></a>Preferences: Display Tab</big></big><br>
<br> The Display Tab is the heart of the graphics control of the emulator.&nbsp; <br> <img src="images/DisplayTab.png" alt="" style="width: 752px; height: 515px;"><br> <br> From here you can change the:<br> <br> <b><u>Display Size</u><br> </b><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp; Display Mode:</b> <blockquote>These
radio buttons allow you to choose to display the emulator in a standard
Aqua window, or to use the entire screen for displaying the
emulator.&nbsp; You can also change the Display Mode setting from the <a href="#Display_Menu">Display Menu.</a><br> </blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b><b> </b><b>Scale Factor:</b> 
<blockquote>In Windowed mode, these radio
buttons allow you to choose between the standard Atari Screen Size
where one TRS-80 pixel is mapped to one Macintosh pixel, 2xTRS-80 size
(oneTRS-80 pixel is mapped to four, 2x2,Macintosh pixels), or 3x TRS-80
Screen size (one TRS-80 pixel is mapped to nine, 3x3,Macintosh
pixels).&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also change this setting from the <a href="#Display_Menu">Display Menu.</a>
&nbsp;Note, on slower Macs, you may want to change your video depth to
Thousands of Colors to achieve full frame rate when using more than 1x
mode. &nbsp;(Don't change this while running the emulator!!!). &nbsp;<br> </blockquote>
<b> </b><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>Window Border Width:</b> 
<blockquote>Put a border of width pixels
around the TRS-80 display. The default is 2.&nbsp;   </blockquote>

<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resize Window on Model 3 Mode Change:</b> 
<blockquote>In Model 3&nbsp; mode,
resize the&nbsp; window whenever the emulated display mode changes
between
64x16 text (or 512x192 graphics) and 80x24 text (or 640x240
graphics).&nbsp;   </blockquote>

<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>Resize Window on Model 4 Mode Change</b><b>:</b> 
<blockquote>In Model 4/4P&nbsp; mode,
resize the&nbsp; window whenever the emulated display mode changes
between
64x16 text (or 512x192 graphics) and 80x24 text (or 640x240
graphics).&nbsp;&nbsp; </blockquote>

<b><u>Display Color<br>
</u></b><b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emulator Colors</b><b>:</b> 
<blockquote>Specifies the foreground and background color
of the sdltrs window.&nbsp; Default is black (0x000000) for foreground and white (0xFFFFFF) for background.<br>
   </blockquote>

<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fullscreen GUI Colors</b><b>:</b> 
<blockquote>Specifies the foreground and background color
of the fullscreen Text GUI.&nbsp; Default is green (0x008010) for foreground and white (0xFFFFFF) for background.&nbsp;   </blockquote>


 <b><u>Disk Leds<br> <br></u></b><div style="margin-left: 40px;">This option allows the user to chose if disk activity indicators are shown in the TRS-80 Emulator window (lower edge).<br>
</div><br>
<b><u>Character Fonts</u></b> <br>
<blockquote>Select among several sets of
built-in character bitmaps.&nbsp; The three different options allow you
to specify the character set used for each model, should you change
models during sdltrs execution using the GUI. &nbsp; In Model I mode , five sets are available.
The default, wider, is a modified Model III set with characters 8
pixels wide; it looks better on a modern computer screen with square
pixels than the real Model I fonts, which were 6 pixels wide. lcmod is
the character set in the replacement character generator that was
supplied with the Radio Shack lower case modification. (It was
reconstructed partly from memory and may have some minor bit errors.)
stock is the character set in the stock character generator supplied
with most upper case only machines. Since sdltrs currently always
emulates the extra bit of display memory needed to support lower case,
this character set gives you the authentic, unpleasant effect that real
Model I users
saw when they tried to do homebrew lower case modifications without
replacing the character generator: lower case letters appear at an
inconsistent height, and if you are using the Level II BASIC ROM
display driver, upper case letters are replaced by meaningless symbols.
early is the same as stock, but with the standard ASCII
characters [, \, ], and ^ in the positions where most Model I's
had directional arrows. This was the default programming in the
Motorola character generator ROM that Radio Shack used, and a
few early machines were actually shipped with this ROM.
Finally, german or genie gives an approximate emulation of the
GENIE, a German Model I clone. Characters are 8
pixels wide, and double width is supported even though later GENIE
models did not include it.<br>
  <br>

In Model III , 4 and 4P ( modes, three sets are
available:<br>

katakana (the default for Model III) is the original Model III
set with Japanese Katakana characters in the alternate character
positions. This set was also used in early Model 4's. international
(the default for Model 4 and 4P) is a later Model 4
set with accented Roman letters in the alternate positions.<br>

bold is a bold set from a character generator ROM found in
one Model III, origin uncertain.<br>

<blockquote>Chose Shift Bracket Emulation on or off.&nbsp; If on, emulate [, \, ], ^, and _ as
shifted keys, and {, |, }, and ~ as
unshifted. This is the default in Model 4 and 4P modes, and it
works well with the keyboard driver in Model 4 TRSDOS/LS-DOS 6. If off, emulate [, \, ], ^, and _ as
unshifted keys, and {, |, }, and ~
as shifted. This is the default in Model I and III modes, and
it works well with many TRS-80 keyboard drivers. With some keyboard
drivers these keys do not work at all, however.
   </blockquote>


<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keystretch Value</b><b>:</b> 
<blockquote>Fine-tune the keyboard behavior.
To prevent keystrokes from being lost, sdltrs "stretches" the intervals
between key transitions, so that the Z-80 program has time to see each
transition before the next one occurs. Whenever the Z-80 program reads
the keyboard matrix and sees an emulated key go up or down, sdltrs
waits cycles Z-80 clock cycles (T-states) before it allows the program
to see another key transition. Key transitions that are received during
the waiting period or when the Z-80 program
is not reading the keyboard are held in a queue. The default stretch
value is 4000 cycles; it should seldom if ever be necessary to change
it.&nbsp;   </blockquote>



 
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Serial Port<br>
<br>
</span></span><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serial Port Switches</b><b>:</b> 
<blockquote>Set the sense switches on the
Model I serial port card. This
option is meaningful only in Model I mode, and only when the Serial Port Name is not set to "". The default value is 0x6f,
which Radio Shack software conventionally interprets as 9600 bps, 8
bits/word, no parity, 1 stop bit.<br>

the list; those drives will get the default values. Setting one
or more of the first four drives to 8-inch may be useful for
CP/M software that supports 8-inch drives. You can also use
XTRS8/DCT with 8-inch drives in the first four positions; even
though the prompt suggests the unit number must be 4-7, numbers
0-3 are accepted. XTRS8 does not check whether the unit you've
selected is really being emulated as an 8-inch drive, however;
you'll simply get errors during FORMAT if you get this wrong.<br>

<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doubler Type</b><b>:</b> 
<blockquote>Specify what type of double
density adaptor to emulate (Model I
mode only). The type may be percom, radioshack (or tandy), both, or
none. The type may be abbreviated to one character. The default is
both, which causes the double density adaptor emulation to respond to
the special commands of both the Percom and Radio Shack cards.&nbsp;   </blockquote>




 <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True DAM Emulation</b><b>:</b>

F8 and FA data address marks is strictly observed on both writing and
reading. This option is probably not useful unless you need to deal
with Model I disks that use the distinction as part of a
copy-protection scheme. See also "Common File Formats for
Emulated TRS-80 Floppy Disks", available at http://www.tim-

</span></span></big></big>The Printer Tab controls the type of printer emulation that is used for
outputting to the printer TRS-80. <br>
<br>
The are four choices for printer emulation, None, Text Printer, Epson
FX-80, and CGP-115. &nbsp;The Text printer simply sends the printer
output to a text file with optional script processing, while the Epson
and CGP-115 choices emulate a legacy printers, and allow the user to
save the
printer output in a PDF file.<br>
<br>
 <img style="width: 726px; height: 491px;" alt="" src="images/PrinterTab.png"><br>
 The sections below describe the options available for each of the printer types.<br>
 <br>
<b><u>Text Printer</u></b><br>
<blockquote> <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Print Command:</span><br>
The only option for this printer type is&nbsp;the command used to print.
&nbsp;Within the command, %s is used to represent the file name of the
temporary file generated during printing. &nbsp;For example, if you wanted
the printed text to be opened in BBEdit, you would enter "bbedit %s"
(without quotes) in the box. &nbsp;By default, the OSX command "open %s" is
used, which will open the printed text in TextEdit by default, unless
you have changed your file associations. &nbsp;The temporary files used for
printing are created in the printer output directory, which you can
choose on the <a href="#Default_Directories_Tab">Default Directories Tab</a>. &nbsp;Also, if you have UNIX printing set up, you could directly print using "lpr %s"<br> </blockquote>
<br>
 <b><u>Epson FX-80 Printer</u><br> </b><br>
 
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Character Set:</span><br>

This&nbsp;option allows you to choose which international character set will
be used by default with the printer. &nbsp;On the real Epson, this was set
by a DIP switch.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"></span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"> Print Pitch:</span><br>

This&nbsp;option allows you to choose which character pitch will be used by
default with the printer. &nbsp;On the real Epson, this was set by a DIP
switch.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Print Weight:</span><br>

This&nbsp;option allows you to choose which character weight will be used by
default with the printer. &nbsp;On the real Epson, this was set by a DIP
switch.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Form Length:</span><br>

This option sets the form length, in inches, for pages output by the
Printer Emulation. &nbsp;On the Epson emulation, this sets both the internal
page length in the emulated printer, as well as determining the length
of a page in the PDF output file from the Printer Emulation. &nbsp;For more
details, see the&nbsp;<a href="#Printer_Emulation">Printer Emulation</a> section.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Auto Linefeed:</span><br>

This option, which is set by default, will automatically add a linefeed
character to every carriage return sent from the emulated Atari to the
emulated Printer. &nbsp;This function was normally performed by the printer
hardware interface or driver on the Atari (Atari 850 or other). &nbsp;If you
get blank lines in your output, you may need to turn this option off.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Print Slashed Zero:</span><br>

This&nbsp;option allows you to choose if zero characters are printed with a
slash by default with the printer. &nbsp;On the real Epson, this was set by
a DIP switch.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Auto Skip Perforation:</span><br>

This option, sets the printer to automatically skip 6 lines at the end
of the page. &nbsp;This is very useful for program listings and other
non-page formated output. &nbsp;On the real Epson, this was set by a DIP
switch. &nbsp;Also, if you choose this option, you may additionally choose
to split the 6 lines between the top and bottom of the page, giving a 3
line margin at the top, and a 3 line margin at the bottom &nbsp;of the page.
&nbsp;This additional option was not available on the original printer.<br>
</div>
           <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">CGP-115 Printer</span><br>
<br>
You can find documentation on the control codes for the CGP-115 Printer, which will explain how to print graphics with here: <a href="http://support.radioshack.com/support_accessories/doc5/5634.htm">http://support.radioshack.com/support_accessories/doc5/5634.htm</a><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Pen 1-4 Color:</span><br>
This&nbsp;option allows you to choose the color of each pen in the
CGP-115 printer. &nbsp;Clicking on the color box will bring up a
standard Mac
color selection dialog.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Print Width:</span><br>

This original CGP-115 used 4" wide paper, and had a print width of
3.77 inches. &nbsp; You can use this original print width centered in normal
width modern paper, or you can specify double print width, in which
case all of the printer output will be scaled up by a factor of 2 (both
height and width), and the printer output will fill most of the width
of modern paper.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Form Length:</span><br>

This option sets the form length, in inches, for pages output by the
Printer Emulation. &nbsp;The real CGP-115 does not have a concept of form
feeds or page length, but this setting is used to determine the length
of a page in the PDF output file from the Printer Emulation. &nbsp;For more
details, see the&nbsp;<a href="../../../Documents%20and%20Settings/markg/My%20Documents/Downloads/atari800-MacOSX-4.1/src/Atari800MacX/Atari800MacX%20Help/PrinterEmulation.html">Printer Emulation</a> help page.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Auto Linefeed:</span><br>

This option, which is set by default, will automatically add a linefeed
character to every carriage return sent from the emulated TRS-80 to the
emulated Printer. &nbsp;This function was normally performed by the printer
hardware interface or driver on the TRS-80. &nbsp;If you
get blank lines in your output, you may need to turn this option off.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Auto Adjust Image to Start of Page:</span><br>
This option automatically readjusts the paper, so that the output of
the printer starts at the top of the page. &nbsp;This is useful for the
CGP-115, as the printer may print above the start paper location, and
would then print off the top of the page.<br>

three choices emulator a legacy printer, and allow the user to save the
printer output in a PDF file. &nbsp;For information on setting printer
options, see the <a href="#Printer_Tab">Printer Tab</a> of the Preferences pane. &nbsp;The current printer can be selected, and preview output opened, by either an entry in the <a href="#Media_Menu">Media Menu</a> or by using the printer area in the <a href="#Media_Status_Window">Media Status Window</a>.<br>
 <br>

The legacy printer emulations allow the user to preview what has been
printed to the printer so far. &nbsp;This preview is presented as a pane
which drops down from the main emulator window, and is shown below.
&nbsp;Besides previewing the output, there are controls that allow the user
to control the emulated printer and output<br>
 <br>
 <img style="width: 613px; height: 509px;" alt="" src="images/PrintPreview.png"><br>
 <br>
 <br>

While the preview is open, the printer is offline, and the main
emulator is paused. The printer comes back online when the preview
sheet is closed.<br>
<p>The preview shows the printed output on one or
more pages of fanfold paper. The length of one page can be chosen in
the Printer tab of the Preferences panel, and is 11 inches by default.
Two purple triangles, on the left and right hand side of the paper,
indicate the "current position"; this is where the next line of output
will appear. &nbsp;Breaks between the pages will appear as dotted lines,
simulating the perforations in fanfold paper. &nbsp;These dotted lines will
not appear in the output.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the sheet are several buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leave in Printer: pressing this button closes the preview sheet without affecting the output.</li><li>Tear
Off and Save: this button saves the print output in a pdf file. It then
clears the print output from the preview and closes the sheet. So
metaphorically this is like tearing off the fanfold paper and storing
the output in a safe place.&nbsp;After saving the output to a pdf file you
can use Apple's Preview program or Adobe Acrobat Reader to view the
output or print it on a real printer.</li><li>Tear Off and Delete: this clears the output without saving it and closes the sheet.</li><li>LF: &nbsp;Line Feed, This will cause the current position of the printer to advance by one line.</li><li>Rev LF: &nbsp;Reverse Line Feed, This will cause the current position of the printer to go back by one line.</li><li>FF: &nbsp;Form Feed, This will cause the current position of the printer to advance to the top of the next page.</li><li>Reset
Printer: &nbsp;This is equivalent to power cycling the emulated printer,
reseting any control characters that may have been sent by the emulated
computer. &nbsp;It will also clear the print output,&nbsp; start at the top of a
blank page, and close the preview window.</li>
</ul>
<b><u>Text Printer<br> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br> </span></span></span></u></b>The
Text Printer is used to send output to a plain text file. &nbsp;The file
will be stored in the default print output directory, which is settable
on the <a href="#Default_Directories_Tab">Directories Tab</a>
of the Preferences window. &nbsp;The file name will be automatically
generated, and will be off the form SPOOL_xxxxx, where xxxxx is a
random character string picked by the program/OS. &nbsp;The file may then be
post-processed by a shell command, which is specified on the <a href="#Printer_Tab">Printer Tab</a> of the Preferences window. &nbsp;By default, the text file is opened in TextEdit.<br>
 <br>
 <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Epson FX-80 Printer</span><br>
 <br>
 The Epson FX-80 was a very popular printer in the 1980's, and is therefore supported by many Atari programs.<br>

The emulation is intended to support all of the functions of the
original printer, such as different character pitches, bold, italic and
underlined text, margins, tabs, and graphic modes. It does not support
user defined characters however. &nbsp;It does support proportional printing
well, as opposed to the Atari 825 emulation's proportional print
support, which is poor.<br>
 <br>
 The technology used by the emulator
for text rendering is very different from the technology used in the
original Epson. As a result, the characters are somewhat different, but
the size and looks of the characters are just like the real thing,<br>

<br>
<img style="width: 264px; height: 268px;" alt="" src="images/MediaMenu.png"><br>
<br>
The Media menu on the SDLTRS emulator allows you to insert and
remove digital media into the emulator, the same way you would on a
real TRS-80. &nbsp;It has the following menu selections:<br>
 <br>
<b><u>Floppy Disk Management (cmd-D)</u><br> </b>
<blockquote>This
menu item supplies access to a full Disk Drive Management window which
allows you to insert and remove disks in all 8 floppy disk drives, as well as
manage the status of the emulated drives and create images.&nbsp; It brings up a window which looks like:<br>
  <br>
  <img style="width: 676px; height: 422px;" alt="" src="images/FloppyManagement.png"><br>
  <br>
  <u><b>Drive Status</b></u><br>
 <br>
 
  <blockquote>Each Disk drive can have one of three states:<br>
<ul><li>Empty - The drive has no disk.</li><li>Read Only - A disk is inserted, but has write protect switch on, so that you may only read from the disk.</li><li>R/W - A disk is inserted, and can be either read from or written to.</li></ul>The Read Only and R/W status of the drive may be set after a disk is inserted.<br> </blockquote>
  <b><u>Eject All<br> </u></b>
  <blockquote>This button allows the user to eject all 8 disks from the drive with one action. &nbsp;It has a keyboard shortcut of command-E.<br></blockquote>
  <b><u>Save Disk Set Button<br> </u></b>
  <blockquote>This
button allows the user to save the names of the disk images that are
currently in the drives to a file, to be loaded later. &nbsp;The file
that
the set is save in has an extension of ".set", and it is a human
readable text file, containing the paths of the image files, or a blank
line for a drive for a drive that has no disk. &nbsp;It has a keyboard
shortcut of
command-S. </blockquote>
  <b><u>Load Disk Set Button<br> <br> </u></b>
  <blockquote>This
button allows the user to load a disk set saved earlier with the Save
Disk Set Button. &nbsp;The user is allowed to browse for the set file,
displaying files ending in ".set". &nbsp;The emulator then loads the disk
images specified in the file into the corresponding drives. &nbsp;If a drive
in the set file is a blank line, no changes are made to the drive.
&nbsp; This allows the user to load multiple disk sets sequentially. &nbsp;It has
a keyboard shortcut of command-L. </blockquote>
  <u><b>New Disk Image Button<br> </b></u>
  <blockquote>This
button will display a new window which you may use to create a new disk
image. &nbsp; It has a keyboard
